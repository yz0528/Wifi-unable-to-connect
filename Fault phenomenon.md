Are other devices on the same wireless network connected normally?
If other devices can connect, is the wireless network password entered correct?
Try to reconnect after forgetting the network operation. Method: Slide down the top curtain of the screen - long press the WLAN icon to enter the wireless network setting interface - tap and hold the name of the wireless network that has not been connected successfully - forget the network and search for the connection again.
If it doesn't work, please restart the tablet and router respectively and try connecting again.
Check the device system version and upgrade to the latest version.
